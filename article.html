    <h2>A new red line through Sydney's rail map</h2>
    <h3>By Matt O'Sullivan</h3>
    <h4>February 21, 2019</h4>
    <div class="div3"><p>Confusion about which rail line is which has
      spurred transport planners to redesign Sydney's rail
      map to make it easier for passengers to understand.</p></div>
    <div class="div3"><p>Since a "T system" was introduced as part of
      an overhaul of the rail timetable in 2013, much of
      the misunderstanding when reading the map has been
      about the T1 line because it encompasses the Western,
      Northern and North Shore lines.</p></div>
    <div class="div3"><p>In an attempt to make it easier for commuters
      and tourists alike, the T1 Northern Line will be renamed
      the T9 Northern Line from April 28. As well, it will drop
      yellow for a distinct red, and extend from Hornsby to
      Gordon via Epping, and Sydney's central business district.</p></div>
    <img class="map" src="subway_map.png" alt="Subway Map" width="50%" height="50%">  
    <div class="div3"><p>The Metro North West line will also make its first
      appearance on Sydney's rail map in its trademark aqua –
      the same colour its driverless, single-deck trains are
      painted in. The new $8 billion line from Rouse Hill in
      Sydney's north-west to Chatswood is due to open in May.</p></div>
    <div class="div3"><p>Transport for NSW said the map redesign was aimed
      at making it easier for customers by reducing the complex
      information about existing services such as the T1 trains.</p></div>
    <div class="div3"><p>"Customer information will now be clearer and more
      concise," it said. "This is not just a rebranding. It is
      about making customer journeys easier and improving their
      ability to plan their trip."</p><div>
    <div class="div4"><p>Diagrammatic maps have played a crucial role in
      ensuring the smooth flow of passengers on railways for
      decades. A map of Sydney's rail network in the 1930s drew
      inspiration from the first diagrammatic map of the London
      Underground by Harry Beck.</p></div>
    <div class="div4"><p>The Tube map has been repeatedly refined since and
      become one of – if not the – best known in the world.</p></div>
